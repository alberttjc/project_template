## [Description] What This Is

This is a repository that collects documentation good practices with examples and bad practices as counter-examples in order to create a repeatible process of creating easy-to-understand documentation.

Although this repository is created with software documentation in mind, I believe the practices are applicable to all technological areas.

## [Usage] Who This Is For

This repository is primarily targeted to software developers who are usually not considered as a documentation writer. However, as I said above, I believe all the developers or engineers who work in the technological areas can be beneficial from it.

## Best Practices

This article ["What nobody tells you about documentation"](https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/) is a must-read! It separates the documentation into four quadrants, each of which takes a different responsibility:

> - Tutorials
>   - is **learning-oriented**
>   - allows the newcomer to get started
>   - is a lesson
> - How-to guides
>   - is **goal-oriented**
>   - shows how to solve a specific problem
>   - is a series of steps
> - Explanation
>   - is **understanding-oriented**
>   - explains
>   - provides background and context
> - Reference
>   - is **information-oriented**
>   - describes the machinery
>   - is accurate and complete

## Installations

## Current Issues

With the above-mentioned four documentation quadrants, I find many documentations are poor because of the lack in "Explanation": they provide a lot of tutorials and how-to guides but fail to give a conceptual explanation of the product components and how and **especially why** they are put that way.

I **strongly believe** understanding `why`s is crucial to using the product correctly, because those `why`s reflect the problems the product is solving. Not understanding the `why`s may result in using the product in the wrong context to solve the wrong problem.

### Reference without Definition

See the section ["Control Machine Requirements"](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-machine-requirements) of Ansible's documentation. This section is the first time the term "control machine" is used, but there is no definition or explanation of what a "control machine" is. The reader needs to infer it from the context.

This looks quite like in a program you start to use a variable without defining it. "Hey," you may argue, "the compiler should be smart enough to figure out what that variable means from its context. Any compiler that's unable to do so is dumb."
